# Add tokens to metamask

Minimal client-side javascript application to add tokens to metamask from a
pre-defined, per-network list.

## TODO

* Add a link from contract address to token contract on explorer
* Add a "copy" link for the contract address
* Add feature to add networks to metamask, cf. chainlist.org
* Add search by symbol
* Add search by contract address
* Add link to a price chart for each token
* Add link to the information source for the token details (contract address)
